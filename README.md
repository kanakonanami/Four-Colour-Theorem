# Four-Colour-Theorem
Coloring the map of 20 arrondissements (administrative districts) in Paris with the fewest colors.
In this map, each region must be colored with exactly one color.

Using Linear Programming and Network, I colored the map of Paris with only 3 colors.

The method can be read from the PDF file I uploaded.
The Code is provided in the Appendix at the end of the paper.
